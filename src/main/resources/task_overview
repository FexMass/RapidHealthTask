Reverse string

Create a function that accepts a single string parameter and results in a return value with reversed string.

Think about immutable data types and implications on heap.

Please provide solution using loop logic as well as an alternative solution using recursion.

Build triangle

Write a function that, when given an int, prints a triangle like the one below.

print_triangle(size=6)
*
**
***
****
*****
******

If a negative value is provided then the triangle should be inverted (reverse print).

Pattern recognition

Build a function which will verify a string against certain pattern.

verify(string, pattern).

Pattern has only one special character '*' meaning any number of any characters (0 included).

You can ignore possibility that "*" will be part of a string.

Examples:
verify("tata", "tata") = true
verify("taat", "tata") = false

verify("tt", "t*t") = true
verify("ttt", "t*t") = true

verify("tata", "*t") = false
verify("tat", "*t") = true
